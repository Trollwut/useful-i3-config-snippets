# Useful i3 config snippets

Well, nothing much to say. While browsing the web, I collect some snippets for the i3(-gaps) config, which might be useful sometimes.

I try to edit them to have standard naming as in the i3 manual, other than that I try to keep vim bindings.

Feel free to contribute your snippets, too!
